We analyze the scientific value and technical feasibility of deploying a dust observatory between Earth and the asteroid belt. Such an observatory would be capable of in-situ dust measurements to better understand dust dynamics in the inner solar system and support space weather modeling.

The study examines:
- Key orbit locations and mission profiles,
- Instrumentation requirements for dust detection,
- Communication, power, and data constraints,
- Potential collaboration with existing or planned missions.

Our results indicate that such a mission is technically feasible with current technologies and could significantly enhance our understanding of interplanetary dust environments.
