Abstract: 
The velocity distribution function of a gas in complete equilibrium and confined in a reservoir at a constant temperature follows the global Maxwellian velocity distribution. However, when a rarefied gas flows through a channel exposed to vacuum, wall reflections significantly affect the velocity distribution, especially if collisions are not specular. Additionally, differences in inlet velocity distribution conditions are expected to influence the outlet velocity. This study employs the direct simulation Monte Carlo method with the Cercignani-Lampis-Lord model, which is close to diffuse reflection. The effects of inlet gas injection methods (parallel and perpendicular) and channel aspect ratio on density and axial velocity distribution were examined. The results show that when the aspect ratio increases, the average axial velocity at the exit plane converges to √(kTₛ/m), which is determined by wall temperature Tₛ, regardless of the inlet condition. Conversely, a shorter channel increases the influence of the inlet velocity condition due to fewer wall reflections. For an aspect ratio of 1, perpendicular injection increased density at the exit region by 20.6% compared to parallel injection.
