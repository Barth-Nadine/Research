Trampolin Trainer (2018/10-2022/09)
======
As a trampoline trainer for the university sports program, I was responsible for leading weekly training sessions for students of all experience levels. My duties included planning and conducting safe and effective workouts, teaching proper jumping and landing techniques, and helping participants improve coordination, strength, and body control. I also organized internal events and supported the preparation and participation in trampoline competitions.
