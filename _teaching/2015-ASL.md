Leading of Robotics Group (2015-2022)
======
After several years of hands-on experience in AEROSPACE LAB’s small satellite team — including participation in the first German CANSAT competition — I wanted to pass on the enthusiasm, technical skills, and mentorship that had shaped my own journey. In 2015, I joined the lab’s Girls Robotics program as a volunteer supervisor, helping to inspire and support the next generation of young engineers.
In this role, I:
*	Mentor and support a group of motivated high school girls in weekly robotics sessions with LEGO EV3
*	Guide the team in preparing for the FIRST LEGO League and the World Robot Olympiad competitions
*	Introduction to electronics and programming fundamentals using Arduino Uno kits
*	Continuously reflect on and improve session structure and learning outcomes

This work combined my technical background with a passion for education, and I’m proud to help foster curiosity and confidence in young people pursuing STEM.
